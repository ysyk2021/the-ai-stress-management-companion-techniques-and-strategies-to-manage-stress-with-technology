Stress is a natural response to challenging situations, but when it becomes chronic, it can have negative effects on our mental and physical health. In this chapter, we will explore the nature of stress, what causes it, and how it affects us.

Defining Stress
---------------

Stress is a physiological response to a perceived threat or challenge. When we encounter a stressful situation, our body releases hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which trigger the "fight or flight" response. This response prepares us to either fight the threat or flee from it.

Causes of Stress
----------------

Stress can be caused by a variety of factors, including:

* Work-related stressors, such as job demands, workload, and interpersonal conflict
* Financial stressors, such as debt or financial instability
* Relationship stressors, such as conflicts with friends or family members
* Health-related stressors, such as illness or injury
* Life changes, such as moving, getting married, or having a child

Effects of Stress

While stress is a natural response to challenging situations, chronic stress can have negative effects on our mental and physical health. Some of the effects of chronic stress include:

* Anxiety and depression
* Insomnia and other sleep disorders
* Digestive problems
* Headaches
* High blood pressure
* Weakened immune system
